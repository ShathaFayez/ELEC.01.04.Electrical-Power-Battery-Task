# ELEC.01.04.Electrical-Power-Battery-Task
This task required to investigate and choose the suitable kind of batteries to power a DC Motor in the robot. The battery with the highest capacity, that can output hundreds of amps easily for long periods of time, and the lowest cost was the preferred one.

After analyzing all the different kinds of batteries being used to power the motors in the robots, I concluded that we should use one of the following types of batteries:

1. Nickel-Metal Hydride Batteries (Ni-MH)

2. Lithium Polymer batteries

3. Lead-Acid/SLA Batteries

These choices are determined based on the voltage rating of the DC Motor with the voltage range 6V â€“ 12V. 
For more information about these batteries see the pdf uploaded.
